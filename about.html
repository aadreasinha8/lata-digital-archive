          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>
            <em>Chitralekha: Lata Mangeshkar Digital Archive</em> is an open-access digital humanities project devoted to the systematic documentation, contextualisation, and scholarly analysis of the recorded repertoire of Lata Mangeshkar (28 September 1929 – 6 February 2022). Widely recognised as the most recorded artist in the history of music, Lata Mangeshkar's voice shaped the sonic and emotional fabric of Indian cultural life across more than seven decades, encompassing tens of thousands of recordings in at least thirty-six languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The archive takes its name from the Sanskrit <em>chitralekha</em> — literally "one who paints pictures in words and sound" — a term that captures the way in which Lata Mangeshkar rendered into living form the imaginative worlds of poets, composers, and filmmakers. The project is housed within the Department of Digital Humanities and aims to serve as a foundational resource for students, scholars, and general listeners who wish to engage seriously and systematically with her body of work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The archive organises its holdings chronologically by decade, from the formative recordings of the 1940s through to the later-period work of the early 2000s, and thematically by emotional register, compositional lineage, and poetic tradition. Each song entry is accompanied by structured metadata, contextual annotation, and links to verified audio-visual sources. The project is committed to open access, non-commercial use, and transparent curatorial practice.

              "Her voice was not merely heard; it was inhabited. For generations of listeners, Lata Mangeshkar's singing constituted the very texture of inner life."

          <h2>Aims and Objectives</h2>
          <p>
            The project proceeds from the conviction that Lata Mangeshkar's work constitutes a body of cultural heritage of the first order — one that has received sustained popular attention but comparatively limited rigorous scholarly treatment in English-language academic contexts. <em>Chitralekha</em> is designed to address this lacuna through the following aims and objectives.
          </p>
          <div class="aims-grid">
            <div class="aim-card">
              <div class="aim-number">01</div>
              <h3>Documentation</h3>
              <p>To create a structured, searchable, and continuously expanding catalogue of Lata Mangeshkar's recordings, prioritising depth of annotation over exhaustive enumeration, and ensuring that each entry meets consistent standards of bibliographic accuracy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aim-card">
              <div class="aim-number">02</div>
              <h3>Contextualisation</h3>
              <p>To situate individual recordings within their broader cultural, historical, and compositional contexts — including the filmmaking traditions, poetic lineages, musical schools, and social circumstances from which they emerged.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aim-card">
              <div class="aim-number">03</div>
              <h3>Analysis</h3>
              <p>To publish original scholarly essays, data visualisations, and comparative studies that advance critical understanding of Lata Mangeshkar's vocal technique, stylistic range, and cultural significance within ethnomusicology, film studies, and South Asian cultural history.</p>

              <div class="aim-number">04</div>
              <h3>Accessibility</h3>
              <p>To make the materials of this archive freely available to researchers, educators, students, and the interested public without restriction, in keeping with the principles of open access scholarship and the democratisation of humanistic inquiry.</p>

              <div class="aim-number">05</div>
              <h3>Preservation</h3>
              <p>To support the long-term preservation of knowledge about a body of recordings that, while commercially available, remains inadequately documented in scholarly terms — particularly with regard to lesser-known regional-language recordings and early career work.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aim-card">
              <div class="aim-number">06</div>
              <h3>Community</h3>
              <p>To foster a scholarly and curatorial community around this archive, inviting contributions from researchers across disciplines and geographies, and modelling best practices in transparent, peer-reviewed digital curation.</p>

          <h2>Digital Humanities Approach</h2>
          <p>
            <em>Chitralekha</em> is designed in accordance with the principles and methodologies of digital humanities scholarship, understood as the application of computational, networked, and data-driven methods to questions arising within the humanities disciplines. The project draws on several traditions within this field, each of which shapes the architecture and practice of the archive in concrete ways.
          </p>
          <div class="dh-approach-layout">
            <div class="dh-text">
              <h3>Structured Data and Metadata Standards</h3>
              <p>Each song entry in the archive is encoded according to a consistent metadata schema that records film title, year of release, composer, lyricist, language, thematic classification, and archival annotation. This schema draws on the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative and adapts it for the specific requirements of South Asian film music documentation. Structured data enables both human navigation and machine-readable outputs for future computational analysis.</p>

              <h3>Corpus-Based Analysis</h3>
              <p>The archive's analytical dimension employs corpus-based methods to study patterns across Lata Mangeshkar's recorded output — including composer collaboration frequencies, language distribution over time, thematic clustering, and the structural features of raag-based compositions. These methods complement, rather than replace, close reading and interpretive scholarship, which remains central to the project's intellectual mission.</p>

              <h3>Linked Open Data and Interoperability</h3>
              <p>Where possible, the archive's metadata is aligned with existing linked open data initiatives, including Wikidata, MusicBrainz, and the National Film Archive of India's holdings. This commitment to interoperability reflects a broader aspiration to integrate <em>Chitralekha</em> with the emerging infrastructure of digital cultural heritage, ensuring that its records are discoverable and usable beyond the boundaries of the project's own interface.</p>

              <h3>Ethical Dimensions</h3>
              <p>The project is attentive to the ethical dimensions of digital archival work, including questions of intellectual property, cultural ownership, and the politics of representation. All audio-visual links connect to officially authorised or public-domain sources. The archive does not reproduce copyrighted material and is committed to acknowledging its own positionality and limitations as a scholarly enterprise.</p>
